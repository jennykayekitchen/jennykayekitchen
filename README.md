### Welcome to my GitHub!
I am proud to be a graduate of the Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp for C# And .NET at Nashville Software School! My passion lies in design and I love using my creativity to find solutions and make things more efficient, whether that's through elegant user interfaces, streamlined processes, or optimized workflows. 

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
Checkout my completed front end capstone for NSS called [My Version](https://github.com/jennykayekitchen/My-Version) and a side project I did called [ClassApp](https://github.com/jennykayekitchen/ClassApp)!

View my final capstone, a full stack application called [The Junior Tri-Wizard Tournament](https://github.com/jennykayekitchen/tri-wizard-tournament)!

Next, I will be working to convert my front-end projects to full stack applications and to deploy them. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I am continuing to learn and work on projects post-graduation, and I've started online courses for QA and TypeScript.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
I would love the opportunity to collaborate on a project where I would get to utilize my passion for design.

## 🏞️ In my free time ...
 I enjoy spending time around a fire pit with my friends, reading a good book, or taking my puppy Archie for a walk at the park. During the warmer months, you'll find me at the lake on paddle board. I'm also a regular at Nashville Soccer Club games!

### Welcome to my GitHub!
I am a current student in the Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp for C# And .NET at Nashville Software School and will graduate in mid-May 2023. My passion lies in design and I love using my creativity to find solutions and make things more efficient, whether that's through elegant user interfaces, streamlined processes, or optimized workflows.

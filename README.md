### Welcome to my GitHub!
I am a current student in the Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp for C# And .NET at Nashville Software School and will graduate in mid-May 2023. My passion lies in design and I love using my creativity to find innovative solutions and make things more efficient, whether that's through elegant user interfaces, streamlined processes, or optimized workflows.

I am currently working on a website with a fellow classmate called ClassApp that will help our cohort stay connected and organized. Whether we're getting together to work on a group project, looking for job leads, or we just want to hang out, ClassApp has us covered. With ClassApp, you'll be able to create, edit, and delete events with ease. Want to schedule a "coffee and coding" meetup? No problem! Want to plan a movie night or happy hour? ClassApp has got our back. Plus, we'll be able to indicate our attendance for each event, so our classmates will know who's coming and who's not. With a special access code, only our cohort 61 peers will be able to register and access the site, ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all.
